We use *tribble* to generate inputs from oracle grammar.

There are two formats for tribble grammars: a text-based format and a Scala DSL-based one.  
The preferred way of providing a grammar to tribble is using its Scala DSL variant because it profits from type checking and syntax highlighting in IDEs.
So we use Scala DSL to describe our Oracle grammar.
